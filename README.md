- **Comprehensive Toolset**: Access a wide range of TagScript functions and operators to simulate different conditions and responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface that makes TagScript testing simple and efficient.
- **Save and Load Scripts**: Save your scripts for future use and load them whenever needed, ensuring you don't lose your work.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Clearly see different elements of your TagScript with our syntax highlighting feature, making it easier to debug and understand your code.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example to demonstrate how to use the bTagScript Playground:

1. **Write a Script**:
   ```tagscript
   {if(Hello=={args}):Hi there!|I don't understand.}
   ```
   This script checks if the user input is "Hello" and responds with "Hi there!". Otherwise, it responds with "I don't understand."

2. **Run the Script**: Click "Run Script" to see the output.
   - Input: `Hello`
   - Output: `Hi there!`

   - Input: `Goodbye`
   - Output: `I don't understand.`
